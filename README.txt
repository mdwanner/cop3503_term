This group project was planned and completed over the course of a semester for the Programming Fundamentals 2 class. It is a text-based role-playing game inspired by the Pokemon series of video games for handheld devices. Features include capturing, training, and battling Pokemon, challenging gyms to collect badges and other (computer-controlled) Pokemon trainers.

While in Explore mode, Pokemon or trainer battle events occur based off random number generation. Caught Pokemon can be leveled and evolve. Towns can be found, and items for healing and catching Pokemon can be purchased using currency obtained from winning battles.
